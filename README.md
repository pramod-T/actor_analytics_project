# ðŸŽ¬ Actor Analytics Platform â€” SQL Data Engineering Project

This project implements a **SQL-based data modeling pipeline** to track actor performance across time using **cumulative history**, **Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**, and **incremental data processing**.

It reflects core data engineering patterns and supports powerful analytics â€” all modeled in **PostgreSQL**.

## Data Model

### Composite Type: `films`

Each actor stores their film history as an array of composite records (`film`, `votes`, `rating`, `filmid`).

```sql
CREATE TYPE films AS (
  film TEXT,
  votes INT,
  rating NUMERIC,
  filmid TEXT
);
